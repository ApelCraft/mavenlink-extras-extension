## Build & Package

By default, generators compress the file that was created by building a js/css/html/resource file. You can [distribute the compressed](http://developer.chrome.com/extensions/packaging) file using the Chrome Developer Dashboard to publish to the Chrome Web Store. 

Run this command to build your Chrome Extension project. The resultant zipped file will be in the package dir. 

```grunt build```
